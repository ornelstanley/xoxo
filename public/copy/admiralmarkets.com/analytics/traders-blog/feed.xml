                    <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/analytics/traders-blog/indices-inauguration-biden?regulator=cysec"><img data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto"   style="width:auto;" class="img-responsive" data-src="https://fxmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/mceu_90281242311611146265058.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European stock markets have seen moderate increases since early in the morning while all eyes are on Washington DC, where, in a few hours, Joe Biden will be sworn in as President of the United States. Markets are eagerly awaiting Biden's arrival at the White House, so that he can kick off the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus plan announced last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, </span><b>Treasury Secretary candidate Janet Yellen </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">stressed the need to put these measures in place in order to avoid a prolonged recession, urging lawmakers to do their best to reduce the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street futures are also moving higher. On the Nasdaq, the rise could be more pronounced at the opening thanks to </span><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/start-trading/contract-specifications/instrument/_nflx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netflix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which climbs more than 13% in the pre-opening of the market after having announced that in 2020 it gained 48% more subscribers than in 2019, and revenue has exceeded 200 million euros.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, Wall Street indices have risen during the election period of the US up to the day of the oath of office, as </span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-aims-for-best-stock-market-rally-in-92-years-ahead-of-inauguration-11611097621"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MarketWatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlights with FactSet data. So far, the steepest rises have occurred with the election of Republican Herbert Hoover, with the S&amp;P 500 rebounding more than 13% from the election to his inauguration. Biden is currently placed in second place, since from November 3 to yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 12.76%.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <title>Aclaris Therapeutics soars after promising study against rheumatoid arthritis</title>
                <dc:creator>Kyle Martin</dc:creator>
                <description>Preliminary data from Aclaris’ second phase study of a rheumatoid arthritis treatment after 12 weeks of clinical activity.</description>

                    <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/analytics/traders-blog/aclaris-therapeutics-rises?regulator=cysec"><img data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto"   style="width:auto;" class="img-responsive" data-src="https://fxmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/mceu_41873578611611144154323.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the trading day yesterday, </span><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/start-trading/contract-specifications/instrument/_acrs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aclaris Therapeutics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo; stock shot upwards with a rise of more than 200%. It overcame the wide gap not only from its previous resistance level at $7.70 and its average of 200 periods in the weekly chart, but also saw it trading at levels unseen since July 2018, marking daily highs at $ 19.80 per share.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These strong rises are due to the fact that it announced preliminary data from its phase 2 study on rheumatoid arthritis treatment, in which the results were very promising. Clinical tests are being conducted for up to 12 weeks in both moderate and severe cases with its oral drug, ATI-450.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This biopharmaceutical company is dedicated to the development of immunoinflammatory drugs, which in recent times have been hit hard on the stock market, but that during the last 3 months they have multiplied their value by 4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically speaking, yesterday's strong rises could be a good foothold for the listing of this company, given that although it cannot be ruled out that it should make a correction in the coming sessions, the announcement of this very promising study may re-launch this company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned before, this rise has achieved the break of 3 levels of resistance (level of 7.70, an average of 200 in red, and level of 16.06), so it is not ruled out that the price can seek some of these levels since they currently act as its main supports. Although at first, it seems that this study has managed to break the downtrend:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shares of Logitech International register a rise of more than 5% in the pre-open of the market after revising up the growth of sales in 2021. Specifically, the PC peripherals company estimates growth in sales this year of between 57% to 60% and an increased quarterly operating income.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Logitech is one of the great beneficiaries of the Covid-19 pandemic as it has caused an increase in demand for hardware to improve the work from home experience, as well as accessories for video games and other leisure activities related to computers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the third quarter alone, Logitech sales increased 85% to $ 1.67 billion according to Reuters.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These good results have been reflected in the price of Logitech on the stock market: it closed 2020 with a revaluation of 106% to $ 97.19 per share. In 2019 they rebounded more than 50%, in 2018 they fell by 7%, in 2017 they rose by 35.81% and in 2016 by 64%.</span></p>

                <title>JP Morgan fuels rumours of a Cellnex purchase and raises the target price.</title>
                <dc:creator>Kyle Martin</dc:creator>
                <description>For some time, the markets have been rumoured that American Tower may buy Cellnex, but according to JP Morgan, there is a possibility that it may happen so</description>
                <content:encoded>
                    <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/analytics/traders-blog/cellnex-jumors-jp-morgan?regulator=cysec"><img data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto"   style="width:auto;" class="img-responsive" data-src="https://fxmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/mceu_72352904011611058334532.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some time now, the markets have wondered about the possibility that </span><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/start-trading/contract-specifications/instrument/_amt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Tower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may purchase Cellnex, which specialises in the management of telecommunications towers. Now, some JP Morgan experts have hinted that there is an increased possibility that it may come to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to wait and see if this happens, but if it does, Cellnex could experience a new bullish rally. Some analysts have raised its valuation up to 73.50 euros, which would mean an upward potential of more than 50%.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last two years, </span><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/start-trading/contract-specifications/instrument/_clnx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cellnex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has undoubtedly been one of the main players in the IBEX35, as it has experienced a strong upward trend where it rose 189.25% from the beginning of 2019 to mid-2020, reaching 60 euros per share, although it is currently trading around 46 euros, in the lower zone of the bearish channel that began after setting all-time highs at the 38.2% fibonacci level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see that the stochastic indicator is at oversold levels on the weekly chart, while its MACD indicator has crossed down the 0 line, which could cause the price to continue correcting. A confirmation would be the bearish crossover from its 18 week moving average (black) to its 40 moving average (orange).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This correction may be due to a natural correction due to the strong rises in recent months, so it could be interesting to value long positions if it finally rebounds to the upside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, the technical situation of American Tower is quite similar to that of Cellnex, since in recent years it has experienced a strong rise which resulted in more than 100 dollars per share, although in its case the bearish crossover has already occurred in the moving averages, so the price could continue with its correction so we must be vigilant and see if it reaches the 38.2% fibonacci level since the strong uptrend began in 2016.</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/analytics/traders-blog/usd-regained-against-euro?regulator=cysec"><img data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto"   style="width:auto;" class="img-responsive" data-src="https://fxmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/mceu_62667088511610974729624.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week begins with the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day holiday in the United States, US stock markets will be closed, therefore we will not have the ability to analyse the US markets. However, next Wednesday, January 20, the inauguration of Joe Biden as is eagerly anticipated to be a major market mover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Joe Biden unveiled his stimulus aid program, which raised some doubts among investors despite the fact that it fulfilled what was expected by the market consensus by reaching a total amount of aid of around 1.9 trillion dollars. One day before the president is sworn in, the US Senate will give the green light to former Federal Reserve President Janet Yellen as Secretary of the United States Treasury, which is why she is expected to support and defend the program presented by the new president due to the current low rate situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, the ECB will hold its first meeting in 2021 on Thursday, so we will have to see if this body decides to take a further step in its measures due to the current situation of the pandemic, since it is still out of control in Europe and is seriously affecting the economy.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">EURUSD Technical Analysis</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite last week&rsquo;s performance, where the dollar continued to recover ground against the EUR, the general sentiment continues to be weak towards the main currencies. If we look at the dollar index, it is still at levels close to its critical level of support, although in recent days it seems to have relaxed volatility. Last week, FED chairman Powell rejected the idea of ​​reducing the bond buying program and carrying out a rate hike in the short term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically speaking, the EURUSD last week was of consolidation, breaking down the 23.6% fibonacci retracement level of the last bullish momentum, although the uptrend is still strong, so we can&rsquo;t dismiss that the EURUSD can perform yet. more corrections in the next few days, but as long as it does not break down both the 1.20 level and its previous resistance level (green), the sentiment will continue to be bullish, reaching levels close to 1.25.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we look at its oscillators, we can see that the stochastic indicator is entering oversold levels and that the MACD indicator is close to making a crossover from the 0 level to the downside, so if this finally occurs, the current correction could take strength.</span></p>

</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical analysis DAX30</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the DAX 30 made a correction of 1.86 % to support its 18-session moving average after recently hitting its all-time highs. This correction, in principle, can be explained due to the growth of uncertainty in the markets around the evolution of the pandemic and the third wave, despite the fact that the vaccination process began a few weeks ago, and several countries electing strict measures including travel restrictions or announcing new lockdows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to be very aware of its current support levels (average of 18 sessions in black and green strip of the previous lateral channel) since a break of both levels could cause the index to seek its average of 200 sessions in red.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brent technical analysis</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vaccination process has only just begun, and The pandemic is still out of control, so several countries are introducing new measures to counter it, which may cause a drop in oil demand. Saudi Arabia recently announced a reduction in its production level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically speaking, the price has been supported by its 18-session moving average, which currently acts as its main support level until it exceeds 55 dollars per barrel, thus seeking the level of 60 dollars until it reaches the long-term downtrend line ( red) in the area close to $ 57.30 per barrel to later begin a new correction in search of its 18-session black moving average again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to see if the price will be able to overcome this downtrend line and to just how the pandemic will evolve in the coming days, since if more countries decide to make the decision to return to lockdown condition, oil could be seriously affected again. As long as you do not lose the 50 level, the feeling will remain bullish.</span></p>

                    <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/analytics/traders-blog/markets-doubt-biden-plan?regulator=cysec"><img data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto"   style="width:auto;" class="img-responsive" data-src="https://fxmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/mceu_97301995811610716395896.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European stocks indices opened the trading day in the red, posting losses between 0.5% and 1%, with similar numbers anticipated in Wall Street futures. It seems that the stimulus plan announced yesterday by president-elect Joe Biden generated some doubts in the markets, despite the fact that it meets expectations of an additional 1.9 trillion dollars in aid.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main question is how Biden is going to achieve the objectives reflected in the plan, taking into account that some of them require a majority in the Senate that the Democrats may not have, for example, the aid promised to states or the vaccination plan. Another issue which arouses suspicions is the fact that the plan triggers debt, considering that it joins another stimulus package approved by Congress, totalling 900,000 million dollars, and the 2.2 trillion package from last March. This debt could be reduced through tax increases, or through the tools afforded to the Fed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the middle of the European trading day, falls began to be more pronounced, especially in the French CAC 40 index, with a decline of 1.3%. Yesterday, the French government announced new restrictions on mobility in order to curb coronavirus infections, which has also worried investors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Cisco Systems reached an agreement to acquire </span><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/es/start-trading/contract-specifications/instrument/acia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acacia Communications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a value of 2.6 billion dollars, although in recent months this purchase has been complicated to the point that Acacia Communications has unilaterally decided to terminate said purchase contract. In response, Cisco has filed a lawsuit in Delaware for this transaction to be completed, since, according to the plaintiff company, all the requirements agreed to complete said agreement are met.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/es/start-trading/contract-specifications/instrument/csco"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cisco System's</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> objective with this purchase is strategic, as it would allow them to increase its portfolio of optical systems. At the time, Cisco stated that the purchase of Acacia would allow them to meet the most demanding requirements of its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making these demands, the price of Acacia Communications has seen a spectacular rise since January 8, with a cumulative rise of 56.85%. Yesterday&rsquo;s trading day saw a rise 31.45%, closing at 113.75 dollars per share, thus breaking the strong lateral that it has seen since the beginning of July 2019, with resistance at the level of 69 dollars per share.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For its part, Cisco also continues its upward trend, rising by 10 dollars until reaching the level of $45.21 per share, up from the lows of $35.36 of October 29.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As shown in the graph, the price has been supporting its 18-session moving average in black to carry out bullish impulses. This trend has recently been confirmed with the crossing of the 40-session orange moving average to its 200-session red moving average. It is interesting to see how it will perform in the next few days, and we will see if it will be able to reach its current resistance level at $48 per share.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The European stock markets started the trading day in the green, registering slight gains throughout the day while they await news from the United States, where this afternoon Federal Reserve Chairman </span><b>Jerome Powell </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is scheduled to appear, although no major changes in the existing stimulus policy are expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greater interest surrounds the economic plan of president-elect </span><b>Joe Biden</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which will be detailed this afternoon and may include new fiscal aid to alleviate the effects of the </span><b>Covid-19</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>crisis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which could exceed 1.5 trillion dollars. Likewise, news indicates that it will contain measures which will speed up the vaccination process. Wall Street futures are also posting moderate gains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slight increases in the main European indices are also driven by good data from Asia: exports in China grew more than expected in December, indicating strong global demand, while machinery orders from Japan were also positive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the European indices, such as London&rsquo;s </span><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/es/start-trading/contract-specifications/instrument/_ftse100_"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTSE100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, registered the most gains by 1:00 p.m. CET (0.6%) despite the strict lockdown measured decreed by the Government in the face of an increase in Covid-19 infections, and signs that Primark (AB Foods), expects to post losses of one billion pounds (1,122 million euros) if the restrictions are maintained until February 27.</span></p>

                <title>Just one week after completing the Acorda Therapeutics stock split, the stock market soared 44%.</title>
                <dc:creator>Kyle Martin</dc:creator>
                <description>Yesterday, Acorda Therapeutics made several announcements which triggered the stock price to rise a week after its stock split.</description>

                    <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/analytics/traders-blog/acorda-stocks-shoot-upwards?regulator=cysec"><img data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto"   style="width:auto;" class="img-responsive" data-src="https://fxmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/mceu_51846661811610623531278.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/es/start-trading/contract-specifications/instrument/acor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acorda Therepeutics Inc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an American company in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sector, concerning the development of therapies to treat and improve the lives of people with neurological issues or disorders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, this company has seen many ups and downs in the stock market. In 2018 it suffered sharp falls in the markets, causing the company to eventually split its stock at a rate of 6 to 1. This decision was taken after an extraordinary shareholders' meeting last July, due to the strong downward pressures which were bearing down on the company, thus requiring them to sustain a minimum price of 1 USD per share to continue trading in the Nasdaq Global Select Market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During yesterday's trading day, Acorda experienced a strong rise of 44.34%, closing at $6.12 per share. These strong increases can be explained by several different announcements, among which Acorda Therapeutics agreed to sell its manufacturing and operations of its INBRIJA product for $80 million in cash to Catalent. Furthermore, this company has also announced a corporate restructuring and cost reduction measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically speaking, we can see that yesterday&rsquo;s strong movement has produced a wide upward gap which contributed to daily highs, which approached its 200-session moving average in the red, leading the price to again trade at last October&rsquo;s levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downtrend is still in force, although in recent months, it has gradually transformed into a lateral trend, which could lead to changes in the trend in the future. It is important to watch its behaviour in the future, since a break of the 200-session moving average that can be sustained over time, and could lead to a change from bearish to bullish trend in the long term.</span></p>

                <description>Carrefour shares soar 14% after Canadian giant Couche-Tard expressed interest in a merger. Will you take advantage of the bullish move?</description>

                    <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/analytics/traders-blog/carrefour-shares-rise-merger?regulator=cysec"><img data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto" data-resize="auto"   style="width:auto;" class="img-responsive" data-src="https://fxmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/mceu_74212183311610547672435.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrefour shares soared more than 14% mid-trading day on the Paris Stock Exchange to 17.60 euros per share, after it was announced that the Canadian supermarket giant Couche-Tard has contacted the French company to initiate "friendly talks" about a merger.
