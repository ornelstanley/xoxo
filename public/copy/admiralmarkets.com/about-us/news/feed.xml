                    <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/about-us/news/changes-xrp-trading-terms"><img data-resize="auto"   style="width:auto;" class="img-responsive" data-src="https://fxmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/mceu_87155378611610620572525.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><b>Dear Clients</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of the recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's </span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filing against Ripple Labs Inc</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company behind XRP token, we have seen numerous leading cryptocurrency trading venues are suspending the ability to trade XRP tokens.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to increased uncertainty regarding the continuity of XRP as a cryptocurrency, and decisions of key market participants beyond our control, we have decided to make the following changes to the trading terms of our CFDs on </span><b>XRPUSD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>XRPEUR</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>XRPBTC</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effective January 13th, 2021, all aforementioned XRP instruments trade in </span><b>close-only</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mode. All clients on all account types will not be able to open a new trade or increase their existing open positions in these instruments.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 29th, 2021 between 16.00-17.00 EET (our MetaTrader time zone) we will </span><b>force the closure of any remaining open positions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in XRPUSD, XRPEUR, and&nbsp; XRPBTC CFDs at prevailing market prices as quoted in our trading platform.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Please note that due to worsening liquidity conditions, we reserve the right to initiate a close out of remaining open positions on any date, including or before </b><b>January 29th</b><b>.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We remind you all that during anxious market conditions, trading affected instruments involves an increased level of risk. Including the risk, there is also a higher probability to encounter:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significantly higher spreads in affected instruments,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inability to obtain live market price information and to timely update accrued profits and losses on open positions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longer order execution times and a higher rate of order rejects,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk of orders being executed at worse prices (slippage), and&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased holding costs applicable to positions left overnight.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will closely follow the unfolding situation and continue to adapt accordingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best to our knowledge and according to public information available to us, no other Digital Currency we offer as a CFD instrument is subject to any similar regulatory actions which could significantly affect its trading conditions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kind regards,&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the changes for European clients' trading accounts with Admiral Markets UK Ltd?</span></h2>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trading conditions</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Admiral Markets Group made the choice, long before Brexit, to standardise its trading conditions within all of the group's entities.</span></p>

You will be able to continue trading with our ultra-competitive spreads down to 0.8 for the DAX30 and 0.6 for the EUR/USD, enjoy super-fast execution and all the other advantages of Admiral Markets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the Admiral Markets Group protects all of its retail clients against negative balance under all European and UK group entities.</span></p>
<p><b>Can I choose to trade with Admiral Markets under European Union regulation?</b></p>

                <title>Changes to cryptocurrency CFD trading terms</title>
                <dc:creator>Kyle Martin</dc:creator>
                <description>The FCA recently announced Policy PS20/10, which prohibits the sale of cryptocurrency derivatives to Retail investors in or from the UK effective January 6</description>

                    <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://admiralmarkets.com/about-us/news/fca-cryptocurrency-regulations"><img data-resize="auto"   style="width:auto;" class="img-responsive" data-src="https://fxmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/articles/mceu_29257363111609157229195.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><b>Dear Traders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite major cryptocurrencies emerging as a major part of global financial newsfeeds, the asset class is still in its early stage of becoming mainstream in the investment world. During this time, financial authorities of different countries often take differing regulatory approaches to address the opportunities and risks in the wider use of digital currencies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are writing to let you know that the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority recently announced Policy PS20/10, which prohibits the sale of cryptocurrency derivatives</span><b> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><b> Retail investors </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in or from the UK effective January 6, 2021.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does this new FCA policy affect your trades?</span></b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a UK financial services firm, Admiral Markets UK Ltd must comply with this new regulation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>If you are a Retail client</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, regardless of your country of residence, beginning </span><b>January 4, 2021</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, your open positions in digital currency CFDs will be switched to close-only mode. After this change, you will not be able to open any new positions, or increase existing positions, in any instruments from this group.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Professional clients</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Admiral Markets UK Ltd are not included in this new policy. If you are registered as a Professional client, nothing will change for you. After the policy will come into effect, you can continue trading CFDs on digital currencies on regular terms.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there any other restrictions or required actions?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. This FCA Policy requires UK investment firms to cease offering crypto CFDs to retail clients. All our clients can still trade over 3000 other CFDs, including commission-free CFDs on stocks, ETFs, indices, commodities, currencies, and bond futures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are ready to help</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not hesitate to let us know if you need any further information regarding the upcoming changes, or how they could affect the way you use our services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
